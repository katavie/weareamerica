The show of their work at the Oâ€™Leary Library at UMass Lowell will be up from May 2 to May 5. On May 2 there will be a gallery reception and conversation. The student authors will be joined by Dr. Johanna Tigert and Director Sheila Kirschbaum to discuss their stories, their process, and also their ideas for expanding students understanding and appreciation for a more diverse America.
